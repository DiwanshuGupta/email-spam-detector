# email-spam-detector
The Email Spam Detector is a lightweight AI-powered web app that classifies emails as Spam or Not Spam using a fine-tuned BERT model from Hugging Face.
Users can paste the content of any email into the app, and the system analyzes it in real-time, providing:

**Prediction**: Spam / Not Spam


**Confidence Score**: How confident the model is in its decision

The app is built with Streamlit for an interactive UI and integrates Hugging Faceâ€™s pre-trained spam detection models for fast, accurate results.
